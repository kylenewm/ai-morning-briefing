In August 2025, OpenAI launched GPT-5, a major upgrade that enhances capabilities in coding, mathematics, and creative writing, representing a substantial leap in AI performance ([OpenAI - Introducing GPT-5](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5)).

In 2025, updates to Claude 4 and Claude Opus introduced enhanced focus and multi-step task handling, with Claude 4 capable of maintaining focus for up to 30 hours, supporting complex multi-step workflows ([Arstechnica, 2025](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/anthropic-says-its-new-ai-model-maintained-focus-for-30-hours-on-multistep-tasks)). The company also expanded its product ecosystem with the launch of a desktop app supporting both macOS and Windows platforms, facilitating broader user access ([skywork.ai, 2025](https://skywork.ai/blog/ai-agent/claude-desktop-2025-strategic-anthropic-analysis)). Strategic growth initiatives include expanding its global workforce and increasing revenue, underscoring its aggressive development and deployment strategies ([CNBC, 2025](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/26/anthropic-global-ai-hiring-spree.html)).
