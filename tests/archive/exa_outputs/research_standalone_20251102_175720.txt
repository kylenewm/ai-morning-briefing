# Recent Developments in Conversational AI and AI Product Management (October-November 2025)

## Voice-to-Voice Models and Infrastructure
Recent advancements include the launch of AI-driven voice agents and infrastructure enhancements. Audiocodes expanded its Voice CPaaS offering with AI agents, enabling more sophisticated voice interactions in enterprise settings ([Audiocodes](https://www.audiocodes.com/news/press-releases/news/audiocodes-expands-voice-cpaas-offering-with-ai-agents)). Deepgram introduced Flux, the world's first conversational speech recognition model, designed to improve real-time voice understanding and enable more natural interactions ([Deepgram](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251002758871/en/Deepgram-Launches-Flux---The-Worlds-First-Conversational-Speech-Recognition-Model)). Helicone has developed tools for routing, debugging, and analyzing AI applications, including the Helicone AI Gateway, which enhances observability and debugging capabilities for voice systems ([Helicone](https://www.helicone.ai/changelog)).

## Conversational AI Platforms
LangSmith and LangFuse have released significant updates to their platforms. LangSmith introduced a No Code Agent Builder, allowing users to create AI agents with memory and guided prompts without coding ([LangChain Blog](https://blog.langchain.com/langsmith-agent-builder)). Both platforms have integrated OpenTelemetry for improved observability, scalability, and vendor-neutral monitoring, facilitating better management of AI agents ([LangSmith](https://langfuse.com/blog/2025-10-29-launch-week-4)).

## Voice Infrastructure and Multimodal Systems
LiveKit announced the introduction of LiveKit Inference, a new platform for deploying real-time voice AI inference at scale, emphasizing low latency and high throughput ([LiveKit](https://blog.livekit.io/introducing-livekit-inference)). Milvus and Pinecone have enhanced their vector database offerings, supporting multimodal retrieval systems that combine
