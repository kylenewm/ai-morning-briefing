RECOMMENDATION FOR DAILY BRIEFING
================================================================================

Review both outputs and consider:

1. CONTENT QUALITY
   - Is the research report accurate and relevant?
   - Are the regular search URLs high quality?
   - Which provides more value for your use case?

2. COST vs VALUE
   - Research: $0.03-0.05/day = ~$1-1.50/month
   - Regular search: Nearly free
   - Is the research quality worth the cost?

3. INTEGRATION
   - Research: Drop-in ready (single formatted report)
   - Regular search: Requires URL processing/fetching

After reviewing, you can:
  - Add research to daily briefing (high quality, ready-to-use)
  - Use regular search as fallback (cost-effective)
  - Use neither (stick with Gmail + Podcasts)
